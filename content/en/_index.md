## About EVERSE

The EVERSE project aims to create a framework for research software and code excellence, collaboratively designed and championed by the research communities, in pursuit of building a European network of Research Software Quality and setting the foundations of a future Virtual Institute for Research Software Excellence.

## Our mission

OSCARS aims to further consolidate past achievements of the Science Clusters into lasting interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices.

Through a cascading grant mechanism, a broad range of research communities will be involved for the development of new, innovative Open Science projects, that together will drive the uptake of FAIR-data-intensive research throughout the European Research Area (ERA).

OSCARS will thus give an opportunity for inter-cluster cross-adoption and co-development of services that will be part of the EOSC Exchange portfolio.

Through OSCARS community-based Competence Centres will be established and operated, virtual research environments will be deployed fostering the alignment of practices in scientific data analysis. Both objectives will contribute to consolidate the role of the clusters as thematic "EOSC Science Cluster Nodes.
